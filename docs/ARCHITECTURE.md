## Development Roadmap

This project follows a phased development approach outlined in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md). The phases are designed to align with the architectural components:

1. Phase 1 builds the foundational state management system
2. Phase 2 implements the command and data layers
3. Phase 3 develops the UI components
4. Phase 4 adds the plugin system
5. Phase 5 polishes the application and completes documentation

Each phase builds upon the architectural principles outlined in this document.
